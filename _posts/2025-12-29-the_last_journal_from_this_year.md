So, for this year-end journal, and also our first journal about our work updates, we will be sourcing some sources from older articles and videos.

Well, I hope you still find this useful.

## ARTICLES

At the end of this month of 2025, I came across an interesting project, although there are actually quite a lot of similar projects on the internet. And, yes! This project is for high-end makers due to its high level of engineering complexity and relatively high cost. However, one thing that caught my attention about the PiBrick Pocket-CM5 is that it was made by an Indonesian, which is clearly very rare. Moreover, the PiBrick Pocket-CM5 was released publicly and opened through the Open Source Hardware Initiation.

News that shocked us finally emerged in the third quarter of 2025. It was news from the European Union that a total ban on *Unlocking Bootloaders* on devices with radio features was issued.

Vacations in the village are a very enjoyable time because the atmosphere is usually very peaceful and there are many simple things to do. However, when there's nothing to do, you can still enjoy the quiet days in the village by writing in a journal or a book. Just like the HaPlay Typopad 3000 does, it accompanies the writer wherever he goes.

But don't be fooled, because this step won't replace the main operating system; instead, Tiny Computer simply runs on top of Android. So your data is safe. Don't worry. Unfortunately, Tiny Computer defaults to Mandarin, which is a real hassle.
