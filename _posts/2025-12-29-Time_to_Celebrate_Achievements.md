Today is the last month and the last week of 2025.

For almost a year, **dhocnet** has been focused on developing an *upcycle* project called **HaPlay Computer**. We have truly spent all our resources in between our busy schedules to redesign smartphones and STBs that have been abandoned simply because they no longer receive software updates from vendors so that they can be productive again, useful again, and not become e-waste.

During this journey, we finally gained a little understanding of what consumer electronics are suitable for reuse, what features should be added and what software is good to include.

In addition to thinking about hardware and design issues, we are also working on fulfilling documentation and user guides so that the movement of the **HaPlay Computer** project can be followed by many parties so that it shows a real impact.

Until now, we, **dhocnet**, are still continuing to develop the **HaPlay Computer** project so that the products created can fulfill at least one need and are comfortable to use for the long term.
