title: "The First Week of the Year Has Gone by"

Oh, we were caught off guard, and before we knew it, we were already in the second week of January 2026!

At the beginning of 2026, we completed an unforgiving editor. The editor we designed has no backspace function, no delete function, no up, down, right, or left navigation. Basically, it's a no-brainer with only two main functions: *Wipe* and *Save*.

We named this editor Tsadest Editor. For feature-averse writers, this editor was made for you.

With Tsadest Editor, you literally don't have to think about anything anymore because all functions have been removed. The only thing you can do is keep writing or stop.

In addition, we also have several new articles and videos that might interest you. Here's the list.

# ARTICLE

Here, we've created an article about Microsoft Edit, a legendary editor that's been transformed into open source software, allowing for wider compatibility and seamless integration with HaPlay products. [Read the article about Microsoft Edit here](https://www.haplaycomputer.com/2026/01/msedit-an-enhanced-dos-text-editor.html).

In addition to Microsoft Editor, we've also added a help article for HaPlay GO Zero model users, covering basic software management.

We've also added a help article for writers using the HaPlay Typo series on Android, covering the steps for integrating GitHub with Markor Editor to facilitate synchronization across devices.

This week's final article is a redefinition of the concept of a distraction-free device according to the HaPlay Computer project. This article explains what distraction-free means for a modern writerdeck and how it should behave.

# VIDEO

As an upcycler, some things may not require a complete overhaul. For example, if you simply want to repurpose old technology into an ebook reader, a few practical steps are sufficient. [Watch how to turn a Lenovo A6000 into an ebook reader](https://youtu.be/dAYuZQZzDCU?si=7TbMrFu-HSeHxPJV).

For minimalist tech enthusiasts, the latest technology isn't an absolute must, as the newest isn't necessarily the most productive. This video explores the old technology that will become the new PDAs in 2026. [Watch the video: New PDAs from Old Technology in 2026](https://youtu.be/4xBfTkCWheA?si=wmwwTAn-XTMThqjo).

Abi Word is a text processing application with comprehensive features yet a slim size, making it quite lightweight. For HaPlay GO Zero users, you can use Abi Word as a powerful word processor for writing. [Here's how to install Abi Word on HaPlay GO Zero](https://youtu.be/2AcgCXurgf4?si=AhD89-XUsxmuFI-8).

As a form of support, DHOCNET Store has released a new video containing a step-by-step guide on how to integrate GitHub with Markor Editor using GitSync, demonstrated using HaPlay Typopad. [Watch the video here](https://youtu.be/t5wZ8MLpsXk?si=JPGoWhSqqjziuCvL).

Microsoft Edit is a legendary text editor that has been around since the days of Microsoft DOS and is still maintained today. However, Microsoft Edit has now become an open source project, making it available for many operating systems, including Android. So, how do you install Microsoft Edit on a HaPlay computer running Android? [Let's watch the full video here](https://youtu.be/11hFXk1J0xw?si=4hNuTzhRrg79gGOc).

In the second week of 2026, we bought an old, but new, phone that was no longer used by its owner to explore. It's the Lenovo A6000. What's it like? [Let's watch the unboxing video here](https://youtu.be/9eqiAyMdBu4?si=VMMwNBR0eAlCzo_j).

In the second episode, we explore the Lenovo A6000, testing its performance, and finding the right function for our next project. [Watch the Lenovo A6000 test](https://youtu.be/DSH0brq6f9I?si=zsZwso9_ghsyUsTg).

For those of you who want to reuse that old phone in your drawer and make it productive again, but don't want to go to extreme upcycling, you can install Termux to increase its functionality. [Watch the video on how to install Termux on Android 5](https://youtu.be/S1x3HEbaNRc?si=YE04Kvgx406PTNhQ).

Writing should be fun and shouldn't require isolating yourself. For example, the HaPlay GO Zero 3 was used to write while relaxing in a mangrove forest in early 2026. [Watch the video here](https://youtu.be/PvV_JEvBFLc?si=wKyvsO1U6DrTGG2m).

Writing is the most flexible hobby because it can be done anywhere, anytime, and with anything. For example, when you're in a bad mood, HaPlay can be used to fill your free time and relieve boredom.
