# About DHOCNETwork HUB on GitHub

**DHOCNETwork HUB** is a portal connecting all content released on all channels managed by **DHOCNETwork**.

Here, we include brief descriptions and links to content locations from various media sources, such as blogs, project sites, and YouTube, packaged into a weekly journal.

The DHOCNETwork HUB weekly journal is intended solely to centralize all released articles and videos for easy access in one place, minimizing the chance of followers missing out on the latest information.

*- We use Google translator engine to translate the language in the journal from Indonesian to English.*{: .w3-serif}
